# Deep-Learning-Reproducability-Project
This is code for a reproducability project for the master course Deep Learning at TU Delft. 
We set out to reproduce part of the results by the following paper: 

## Cheerla, A., & Gevaert, O. (2019). Deep learning with multimodal representation for pancancer prognosis prediction. Bioinformatics, 35(14), i446-i454.

The blogpost detailing our findings and explaining our process can be found at https://medium.com/tudelft/reproducing-a-deep-learning-paper-5c1c327a5fba
